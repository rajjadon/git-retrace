/**
 * Buckets open PRs into the board's columns. Only surfaces PRs the user actually has a stake in —
 * authored by them, still owed a review from them, or already reviewed by them — dropping the
 * rest: a triage board for "what needs my attention" shouldn't also show every other PR in a busy
 * shared repo. `|| pr.reviewedByMe` matters: without it, a PR you reviewed but don't own vanishes
 * from the board the moment the host removes you from `requestedReviewers`, instead of moving to
 * "Reviewed" the way it should.
 *
 * Pure — no I/O, no host-specific knowledge. Each `ForgeClient` normalizes its host's API shape
 * into `PullRequestSummary` first; this only ever sees the common shape.
