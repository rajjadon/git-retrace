# GitLore

**The story behind every line.**

Free, local-first git insight inside VS Code — blame, history, an interactive commit graph,
branch comparison, a rebase editor, and a cross-repo PR triage board. No account, no paywall,
no telemetry, no backend.

</div>

---

## What is this?

Open any file in any git repo and GitLore answers the question you actually have: **who wrote this line, when, why, and what else changed with it.**

It does that without leaving your editor, without signing in, and without sending your code anywhere. Everything runs against the `git` binary already on your machine.

If you've used similar VS Code git extensions, GitLore covers the same core ground — inline blame, a commit graph, commit details, branch comparison — with every feature free and a deliberately smaller surface area. See [How it compares](#how-it-compares).

> **Status: 1.1, stable.** Everything below works and is covered by tests — 605 unit tests and 112 integration tests against a real VS Code instance. Bug reports are very welcome.

## Install

**From the Marketplace** — search *GitLore* in the Extensions view (`⇧⌘X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`) and click Install. Or from the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension RajpratapsinghJadon.gitlore
```

**From a `.vsix`** — grab one from [Releases](https://github.com/rajjadon/gitlore/releases), then:

```bash
code --install-extension gitlore-1.1.0.vsix
```

Requires **VS Code 1.85+** and `git` on your `PATH`. Works in Cursor and other VS Code-based editors.

## Getting started in 60 seconds

1. **Open a file in a git repo.** The current line's author and age appear at the end of the line, and in the status bar.
2. **Hover that line** for the full commit message, dates, and the diff stat.
3. **Open the panel** — `⌘J` / `Ctrl+J`, then pick the **GitLore** tab (next to Terminal and Output). The commit graph loads itself.
4. **Click any commit row.** Its details load in the pane beside the graph — every changed file, collapsible, with a real diff gutter.
5. **Everything else is a button** in each view's title bar. You never need the command palette.

## Features

### Inline blame, where you're already looking

<img src="media/screenshots/inline-blame.png" width="470" alt="Inline blame decoration at the end of the current line, with the hover card open showing author, message and dates" />

The current line's author and age, as a muted end-of-line decoration. It updates when you change lines — not on every cursor move — and the hover card adds the full message, relative *and* absolute dates, that commit's diff stat for this file, and the short SHA. Customise the text with `gitLore.blame.format`, or turn it off entirely.

The hover card also has **Compare** / **File History** / **Copy SHA** quick actions, and an **Older** link that steps backward through that exact line's own history (real per-line tracking, not just "commits that touched this file") — ◀ prev / next ▶ through every revision that changed the line, without leaving the hover.

### An interactive commit graph, in the panel

<img src="media/screenshots/commit-graph.png" alt="The GitLore panel showing the commit graph with branch labels, a working-changes row, pull/push badges, and commit details beside it" />

A repo-wide, branch-and-merge-aware graph — not a flat log. Branch, tag and remote-tracking labels are each styled distinctly, uncommitted work is pinned at the top as a **Working Changes** row, and the toolbar lets you scope to one branch, filter by message/author/SHA as you type, and refresh. Arrow keys move the selection; Enter opens the commit.

Pull and push buttons sit in the toolbar too, badged with how many commits you're behind/ahead of the upstream (hidden when there's no upstream to compare against) — both run in a real terminal, so you see prompts and conflicts instead of them failing silently. The graph also auto-refreshes on any external `git pull`/push/checkout, not just its own buttons.

### Commit details you can act on

<img src="media/screenshots/commit-details.png" alt="Commit details showing the action bar and a per-file collapsible diff with old and new line numbers in a gutter" />

Each changed file is its own collapsible section holding only that file's hunks, with a filter box for large commits. Diffs show **old and new line numbers in a gutter** and tint changed lines, so you can see *which* line moved — and line numbers stay out of your text selection, so copying a diff gives you just the code.

**Copy SHA**, **Copy message**, and **Open on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket** sit in the action bar. **Open changes** on any file row hands off to a real diff editor when you want syntax highlighting and folding. Commit messages also linkify issue references (`#123` by default) straight to your tracker — see [Issue and PR links](#also) below.

### Branch comparison without modal prompts

<img src="media/screenshots/branch-comparison.png" alt="Branch comparison showing two ref pickers with a swap button, Ahead/Behind/All Files tabs with counts, and Create PR and Open all changes buttons" />

Two ref pickers with a swap button, and **Ahead / Behind / All Files** tabs with counts. It opens on your current branch versus its upstream, so it's useful immediately — retarget either side in place. Diffs are taken against the merge-base, matching what a GitHub or GitLab pull request shows you.

**Create PR** opens your host's compare/create-PR page pre-filled with both branches (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket — hidden on hosts GitLore doesn't recognize, rather than guessing a URL that might 404). **Open all changes** opens every changed file's diff at once instead of one at a time, all against the same common base.

### Launchpad — a cross-repo PR triage board (off by default)

<img src="media/screenshots/launchpad.png" alt="Launchpad showing an eight-column board: Needs Review, Ready to Merge, Waiting, Blocked, Drafts, Snoozed, Merged, and Closed, each with pull request cards, and a repo row above with Pull/Push buttons" />

The only GitLore feature that reaches beyond your local `.git` — everything else above works fully offline. **GitLore: Open Launchpad** opens a 9-column board (Needs Review, Reviewed, Ready to Merge, Waiting, Blocked, Drafts, Snoozed, Merged, Closed) pooling PRs across every recognized remote in your workspace, so triaging what needs your attention — and seeing what you've recently shipped — doesn't mean tab-switching between repos and a browser. Once you've approved or requested changes on a PR you don't own, it moves to **Reviewed** and stays there regardless of what happens to it afterward (CI turns red, a conflict appears, another reviewer requests changes) — unless the host puts you back in as a requested reviewer, which sends it back to **Needs Review**. **Merged** and **Closed** show your own most-recently-completed PRs; every card in an open column also gets **Approve**, **Request changes**, and **Close PR** actions (each with a confirmation first) — right from the board, no host website required. A **Ready to Merge** card also gets a **Merge PR** action — pick a strategy (Merge, Squash and merge, or Rebase and merge, filtered to what that PR's host actually supports) and optionally delete the source branch, then confirm. A **Closed** (not merged) card gets a **Reopen PR** action — Bitbucket Cloud is the one exception, since it has no way to reopen a declined PR at all, on its API or its own web UI. A row above the board lists every recognized repo with **Pull**/**Push** buttons — a purely local git operation, so it works even for a repo whose forge sign-in was skipped or failed.

Every card's **View diff** button opens a docked **Pull Request Details** panel (next to Commit Details) with that PR's changed files and diff, its review conversations — each showing the `path:line` it's anchored to when it's a code comment, plus a **Resolve** button — a comment box to post a top-level comment, and a **Refresh** button to pick up changes made elsewhere — no browser round-trip just to review and weigh in.

<img src="media/screenshots/pull-request-details.png" width="480" alt="The Pull Request Details panel showing changed files with a diff gutter, review conversations with a path:line label and a Resolve button, and a comment box" />

Not GitHub-only: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps are supported out of the box, plus self-hosted or custom instances (GitHub Enterprise Server, Gitea, Forgejo, self-hosted GitLab) via `gitLore.launchpad.customHosts`. GitHub and Azure DevOps Services (`dev.azure.com`) both use VS Code's own built-in sign-in (GitHub's session, and Azure DevOps' Microsoft/AAD session — the latter also works for organizations whose Conditional Access policy blocks Personal Access Tokens outright); every other host, including self-hosted Azure DevOps Server, needs a Personal Access Token, entered once and stored in VS Code's encrypted secret storage — never a GitLore backend, never a key GitLore itself handles.

Off by default (`gitLore.launchpad.enabled`) — it's opt-in, same as AI, since it's the one feature that calls out to a remote host at all. Scans every remote on every repo in the workspace, not just `origin` (a fork's `upstream` included), deduped when two remotes point at the same actual repo. Once enabled, it's also one click away from the Commit Graph panel's toolbar, not just the Command Palette.

### Sidebar Explorer — one tree for the whole repo

<img src="media/screenshots/sidebar-explorer.png" alt="The GitLore Explorer sidebar showing Branches, Remotes, Tags, Stashes, Worktrees, and Contributors sections" />

Branches, Remotes, Tags, Stashes, Worktrees, and Contributors, each a collapsible section, always visible in its own activity bar icon — no command needed to open it. Right-click a branch to **Checkout** or **Compare with Current Branch**; right-click a remote to **Open Remote in Browser**; right-click a stash to **Apply** or **Drop** (with confirmation — it can't be undone).

### File History

<img src="media/screenshots/file-history.png" alt="The File History panel listing every commit that touched the current file, newest first, with author and age" />

Every commit that touched the current file, newest first, following renames, right in the Explorer sidebar — no separate view to open.

### Visual File History

<img src="media/screenshots/visual-file-history.png" alt="Visual File History showing an author-swimlane bubble timeline with additions and deletions bars beneath" />

An author-swimlane bubble timeline as an alternative to the tree above: each commit is a bubble sized by how much it changed, positioned by author lane and by age, with additions/deletions bars beneath. Click a bubble to open that commit's details.

### Interactive Rebase Editor

<img src="media/screenshots/rebase-editor.png" alt="The Interactive Rebase Editor listing commits with pick, squash, and reword actions, drag handles, and Start Rebase / Abort buttons" />

Reorder, reword, edit, squash, fixup, or drop commits with a real UI instead of hand-editing the `git rebase -i` todo file. **GitLore: Rebase Branch Interactively...** picks a target ref and starts one — or it just works if you already use `code --wait` as your own git `sequence.editor`. GitLore never runs `rebase`, `--abort`, `--continue`, or any reset/checkout command itself: it only ever reads, writes, and closes the one file git already opens for this.

### Stale-code detector

<img src="media/screenshots/stale-code.png" alt="A CodeLens reading 'Stale · last changed 1 year ago' above an untouched function, with no lens above a recently changed one" />

A CodeLens above functions, methods, and classes untouched for longer than `gitLore.staleThresholdDays` (180 by default), reading how long it's been and who last touched it — click through straight to that commit. Nothing shows above code that's actually been touched recently, so the signal stays legible even in a large file.

### Author ownership heatmap

<img src="media/screenshots/ownership-heatmap.png" alt="The File Ownership quick pick showing each author's recency-weighted percentage and line count, with color marks in the editor's overview ruler" />

An overview-ruler color mark per line, by that line's author (`gitLore.ownership.enabled`, off by default). **GitLore: Show File Ownership** adds a recency-weighted breakdown — who owns the file, not just who has the most raw lines, so a large old contribution doesn't outrank a smaller recent one.

### Full-file blame heatmap

<img src="media/screenshots/full-file-blame.png" alt="A hot-to-cold recency gradient as a colored left edge on every line of the file" />

A hot-to-cold recency gradient as a left-edge mark per line, across the whole file (`gitLore.fullFileBlame.enabled`, off by default) — relative to the file's own age range, so even an entirely old file still shows which of its lines are relatively newer. Distinct from the current-line inline blame decoration and the ownership ruler above: a third, independent visual, not a mode of either.

### AI commit summaries, line explanations, and commit messages

Opt-in (`gitLore.ai.enabled`, off by default) — nothing is sent anywhere until you turn it on, and it uses whatever language model you've already registered with VS Code (e.g. GitHub Copilot Chat) via the built-in Language Model API. No GitLore backend, no API key, no account.

- **Summarize** in Commit Details streams a plain-English summary of the open commit.
- **Explain this line with AI**, from the blame hover, answers "why does this line exist?" using that line's blame and diff history.
- **Generate Commit Message with AI**, a sparkle button in the Source Control panel's title bar, drafts a message from your staged diff straight into the commit box — GitLore never stages or commits anything itself, it only fills in the text VS Code's own Source Control view already owns.

Each degrades to an inline hint rather than erroring when no model is registered.

### Also

- **Issue and PR links** — `#123` in a commit message becomes a link, auto-detected from your remote or pointed at any tracker (Jira included) via a regex and URL template. Visible inline wherever a commit message renders — no separate view of its own.

## Privacy

GitLore runs entirely locally. Your git data never leaves your machine.

The one network request it makes on its own: author avatars from `gravatar.com`, keyed by an MD5 hash of the commit email — that's Gravatar's own lookup spec, not a security-relevant use of the hash.

A few things open your browser, and only when you click them: **Open on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**, **Create PR**, **Open Remote in Browser**, and issue links. Every one of those URLs is built locally from your git remote; GitLore doesn't contact the host to construct them.

**Launchpad is the one exception to "everything is local"** — it's off by default (`gitLore.launchpad.enabled`), and only fetches PR data from hosts you've explicitly authenticated with (VS Code's own built-in sign-in for GitHub and Azure DevOps Services, or a Personal Access Token you provide for anything else, stored in VS Code's encrypted secret storage). No GitLore backend ever sees your code, your token, or your PR data — GitLore talks directly to the host you configured.

No telemetry. No analytics. No account.

## How it compares

GitLore is not trying to out-feature the bigger, paid alternatives — it's trying to be the free, fast, small part you actually use every day. Honest accounting:

**What GitLore does** — inline blame and hover, status bar, file history (tree and visual), a self-refreshing commit graph with pull/push, commit details with per-file diffs, an interactive rebase editor, branch comparison, a repo-wide sidebar explorer, a cross-repo PR triage board, AI commit summaries, AI line explanations, AI-drafted commit messages, stale-code detection, ownership and recency heatmaps, and issue linking. All free, forever.

**What it deliberately doesn't** — staging, stashing or committing itself (that's VS Code's own Source Control view; GitLore only helps draft the message that goes there, and the graph links to Source Control for everything else), and anything behind a sign-in.

**What's missing for now** — a file-tree view of changed files (GitLore's diffs list files flat, not nested by folder). See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the current list.

## Contributing

```bash
npm install
npm run watch     # rebuild on change
npm run lint      # eslint + tsc --noEmit
npm run test      # unit + integration
```

Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host with GitLore loaded.

- `npm run test:unit` runs just the fast, VS Code-free tests over `src/core` and the renderers.
- `npm run package` builds a `.vsix`; `npm run package:pre` builds a pre-release one.
- `npm run icon` re-renders `media/icon.png` from `media/icon.svg` (needs `rsvg-convert`).

Architecture, conventions and the roadmap live in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). The short version: `src/core/` is pure logic with zero `vscode` imports and is unit-tested in isolation; everything VS Code-facing sits in `providers/`, `views/` and `commands/`.
